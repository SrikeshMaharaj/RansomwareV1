# RansomwareV1
VERY Basic Ransomware script (FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!!)

The program encrypts files in the current directory using a randomly generated encryption key, rendering them unreadable or unusable. It then requests payment for the decryption key, giving the impression that the files can be retrieved after payment. However, once payment is made, the program does not provide the decryption key and instead insults the victim and shuts down their computer.
